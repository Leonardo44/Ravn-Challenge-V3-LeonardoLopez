# Ravn-Challenge-V3-LeonardoLopez
## Project description
SpaceX-Ravn is an application in which users can see the list of missions performed by SpaceX, in addition to the list of missions, the user can see extra information about the mission (youtube video, details and link to more information). It is an application developed in swiftUI and can be run with iOS version 16 or higher.

The application gets the information from this [API](https://github.com/apollographql/spacex) and works directly with graphql object lists.

## Overview of the architecture used and class responsibilities
Concepts such as MVVM, Singleton and separation of service layers (clean architecture concept) were used for this application. 

### MVVM.
This architecture was used to separate the view from the logic of retrieving information from the API. The main views are ListMissionsView.swift and MissionDetailView.swift, the models in this case were used the models that the apollographql package gives us in graphql and the view models are MissionDetailViewModel.swift and ListMissionViewModel.swift, these last ones are in charge of connecting the services that recover the information of the API with the views.

### Singleton.
In this case we used singleton to configure the apollographql client (called NetworkApolloSingleton) and the service (called MissionService.swift) that executes the queries to get the API information.

## Clean architecture to order folder and classes.
In the development of the application we tried to separate the views and folders as convenient as possible. SpaceX-Ravn is an application that consists of two main folders, Core and Ui.

In the Core folder you can find all the possible logic and classes that do not interact directly with the UI but are responsible for transforming or retrieving information from the API.

In the UI folder you can find all the views and elements (such as the string in 2 languages), that is to say that in this folder we tried to place everything that the user can possibly see in the application.
